# AsarSyntaxHighlight-VSCode
Asar syntax highlight for Visual Studio Code

## Features
- Support for every function and directives in Asar 1.81
- Support for 65c816, SPC700 and GSU/Super FX mnemonics
- Custom scopes for literally everything supported
- (Hopefully) smarter than the current options at the extensions marketplace

## Previews
Check the `samples` folder contents for some live previews of the highlighter.

Some color settings have their own previews in `user-settings` folder's README.md file, you can check them out there.

## Extra info
You can check which scopes are affecting the text in the file by using `Developer: Inspect Editior Tokens and Scopes` in the command palette in VS Code.

## Bugs
See the [current issues](https://github.com/TheLX5/AsarSyntaxHighlight-VSCode/issues) in order to check what's missing or doesn't work.
