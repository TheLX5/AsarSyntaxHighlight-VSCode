## Current themes

* `old-default.json` (lx5) - Quickly made based on my own preferences [[PREVIEW](https://imgur.com/a/Ob0Mz95)]
* `nordish.json` (Underrout) - Inspired by [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-visual-studio-code) color scheme, looks best with Nord set as the Color Theme for the editor [[PREVIEW](https://i.imgur.com/cWDDguB.png)]
