# Asar Syntax Highlighter

Official GitHub Repo: https://github.com/TheLX5/AsarSyntaxHighlight-VSCode

The best syntax highlighter for [Asar](https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar) projects.

## Features
- Support for every function and directives in Asar 1.81
- Support for 65c816, SPC700 and GSU/Super FX mnemonics
- Custom scopes for literally everything supported
- (Hopefully) smarter than the current options at the extensions marketplace

## Extra info
You can check which scopes are affecting the text in the file by using `Developer: Inspect Editior Tokens and Scopes` in the command palette in VS Code.
